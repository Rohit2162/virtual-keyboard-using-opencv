# Virtual Keyboard Project using OpenCV

The most widely used library for computer vision is known as OpenCV; it is a cross-platform open-source library for machine learning, image processing, etc. that is used to create real-time computer vision applications.

Using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries as its foundation, CVzone is a computer vision package that makes it simple to execute tasks like hand tracking, face identification, facial landmark detection, position estimation, and other tasks related to computer vision.

A "Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV" project is an innovative application that harnesses the power of computer vision through OpenCV. It enables users to interact with computers and devices by typing without a physical keyboard. Instead, it employs a camera to track and interpret the movements and gestures of the user's hand.

# Project Highlights:

**OpenCV Integration:** The core of this project revolves around OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library. OpenCV is used to capture real-time video from a camera, process the video frames, and analyze hand movements.

**Gesture Recognition:** The system is designed to recognize specific hand gestures and finger movements, translating them into corresponding keyboard inputs. For instance, tapping a finger on a virtual key or swiping the hand can simulate key presses.

**Virtual Keyboard Interface:** Users interact with a virtual keyboard displayed on a screen. This interface allows users to see the keys they select. When the system detects a hand gesture associated with a specific key, it emulates a keyboard input, effectively enabling users to type and communicate.

**Touchless Interaction:** The project offers a touchless and more hygienic way of interfacing with devices, which is particularly valuable in situations where physical keyboards may not be practical or safe.

In essence, a "Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV" is an exciting intersection of computer vision and human-computer interaction, offering an innovative and touchless solution for typing and input.
