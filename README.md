# Virtual Keyboard Project using OpenCV

The most widely used library for computer vision is known as OpenCV; it is a cross-platform open-source library for machine learning, image processing, etc. that is used to create real-time computer vision applications.

Using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries as its foundation, CVzone is a computer vision package that makes it simple to execute tasks like hand tracking, face identification, facial landmark detection, position estimation, and other tasks related to computer vision.

A cutting-edge application that makes use of OpenCV and the capabilities of computer vision is called the "Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV" project. It allows users to type on computers and other devices without using a physical keyboard. Instead, it makes use of a camera to monitor and decipher the user's hand's motions and gestures.

# Project Highlights:

**OpenCV Integration:** This project's central component is OpenCV, a flexible computer vision library. Real-time video from a camera is captured, processed, and hand motions are examined using OpenCV.

**Gesture Recognition:**  The programme is made to identify certain hand gestures and finger motions and convert them into keyboard inputs that correspond to those movements. For instance, swiping the hand or tapping a finger on a virtual key might resemble pressing keys.

**Virtual Keyboard Interface:** Users interact with a virtual keyboard displayed on a screen. This interface allows users to see the keys they select. When the system detects a hand gesture associated with a specific key, it emulates a keyboard input, effectively enabling users to type and communicate.

**Touchless Interaction:** The project offers a touchless and more hygienic way of interfacing with devices, which is particularly valuable in situations where physical keyboards may not be practical or safe.

In essence, a "Virtual Keyboard using OpenCV" is an exciting intersection of computer vision and human-computer interaction, offering an innovative and touchless solution for typing and input.
